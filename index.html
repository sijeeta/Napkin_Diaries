                        <h3>History</h3>
                        <p> The term ‘napkin’ comes from the Late Middle English nappekin, from Old French nappe (tablecloth, from Latin mappa). Paper napkins 
                        <br> are said to originate from China in the second century AD. According to some sources, napkins started out as soft dough used by
                        <br> the Spartans in Greece to clean their fingers.The Romans later introduced napkins of two different sizes: one for wiping the hands
                        <br> and mouth, and one for covering the lap.<br><br>
                        </p>
                        <h3>In a meal Setting:</h3>
                        <p>After seated at restaurant, the next thing should be placing the napkin at lap. When placing Dinner or Bistro or Silverware napkins
                        <br>in lap, the napkin should not be used to wipe face,blow nose or wipe silverware.When a meal is done, loosely fold the napkin and place 
                        <br>it in left or right side of your plate. Donot drop on floor or in chair.

                            <br>compostable and biodegradable, which makes them an eco-
                            <br>friendly alternative to paper napkins. They are also soft
                            <br>and durable.
