# Napkin_Diaries
We use it almost every day! But do we know to tell them apart? It's Napkins! They are simple, small but play an important part in our day-to-day activities. The project is intended to share some basic details on different types of Napkins that we happen to use almost everyday. 

<br> Please feel free to share your feedback or add details to the project.
